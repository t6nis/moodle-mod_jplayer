Moodle JPlayer for Moodle 2.x

 * INSTALL *

Be sure to always install the stable branch that matches your moodle version!
The master branch is compatible with the latest Moodle and not guarenteed to work on earlier versions.
If you are on M2.1 for example, you should be installing the copy from the MOODLE_21_STABLE branch.

Further note, that when downloading from github, this plugin will be in a folder
called 'netspotau-moodle-mod_lightboxgallery'. You need to place this in your
mod/ folder found inside your Moodle installation. You'll also need to rename
it to just 'lightboxgallery'.

More info can be found in the docs here:
