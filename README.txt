JPlayer for Moodle 2.x
(A video player module)

This module is a lightweight version of MPlayer. It is based on the latest JW Player(free version only).
Most of the specific functionality(Snapshots, Metaviewer, skins etc..) introduced by MPlayer 
for Moodle 1.9 are not supported.
This module allows you to playback videos(.mp4, .flv, .webm) on your Moodle course.
You can also add Youtube playlists of videos and add captions.
As a course teacher, you are able to create, edit and delete JPlayer instances.

This plugin was designed for Moodle version 2.0 and upwards
